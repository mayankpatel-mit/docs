# Development of SDK

At **Mirats Publisher Platform**, we're committed to providing the best tools to simplify your integration process. Our team is working tirelessly to deliver **SDKs** that will make it even easier for you to interact with our platform.

But don't worry! You don't have to wait to start using our platform's full potential. While we're building these SDKs, you can still access all of our platform's powerful features via our **API**.

### 📘 Get Started with Our API

Until the SDKs are released, you can integrate with the platform by visiting our **[API Reference](https://docs.publisher.miratsquanto.com/api-reference/introduction)**.

Here’s what you can do with the API:

- 📝 **Create and manage surveys** easily.
- 🎯 **Target global audiences** with robust filtering options.
- 📊 **Monitor real-time analytics** to optimize your campaigns.
- 📈 **Track KPIs** and measure your success.

We’ve designed our API to be intuitive and flexible, giving you full control over your integration process. 

### Stay Tuned!

Our SDKs are on the way, but you can already take full advantage of the **Mirats Publisher Platform** through the API. We’re excited to support your growth and success, and we’ll keep you updated on the SDKs’ release!
